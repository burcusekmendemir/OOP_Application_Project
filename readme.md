##  Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) Application Project

     In a disaster scenario, people get sick and infect each other. In our application; 
     People to be treated and vaccinated are determined, vaccinated and registered. 
     What is expected of us is to divide people into groups;

     Regular person; can carry the disease, can get sick
     The doctor is vaccinated against the disease but can transmit the disease.
     Superhuman does not get sick or transmit disease.

     Situations;
       Defining these types of people to include heredity
       Defining a health class and adding the "make vaccination" method to it.
       This method can take human objects into it. Let him vaccinate only normal 
       people who can be infected with the disease and add the vaccinated people to a list.
       Let's have a report screen where we can see the list of vaccinated people.
